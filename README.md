# NodeJS + MongoDB API Architecture Template

It's a template of structured directories and files to quickstart a node API project, using express, body-parser, mongoose, cors, dotenv and mngoose. 
The idea of this repository, is to use it to clone, and make faster the coding process (and use it as potfolio, as well). Feel free to read, clone, and comment.
API testing tool recommended, as postsman, insomnia etc.
